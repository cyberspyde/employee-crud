1. Picture upload should be from local pc, not some link. GOING
2. Adding a new employee should not ask for an employee id, it has to be autofilled.
3. Settings page is empty.
4. Top right of the page should not display anything, currenty has a round A icon displayed as a profile. We don't need that.
5. We need admin unlock modal before letting anyone access the page, admin unlock password is "admin123" by default, and can be modified from settings page inside. Modal password doesn't use encryption and saved as clear text.
